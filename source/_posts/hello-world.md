Welcome to my blog. This is a beautiful place where I will share my knowledge with the world.

Mostly, here you will see something related to my passion for technology and software engineering, perhaps with some occassional thought exercise on things larger than life.

You are welcome to engage in any discussion as long as your goal is the same as mine - to understand the world better.
